  [Activation] Use this skill when the user provides a paper PDF (file path or upload) and asks to verify, audit, or fact-check its references / citations / bibliography — e.g. "check whether the references in this PDF are hallucinated", "find fake citations", "verify the bibliography".
  [Capability] Uploads the PDF to the AMiner pdf-citation-verifier service, polls the asynchronous job, and returns a per-reference classification (REAL / LIKELY_REAL / NEEDS_REVIEW / LIKELY_FAKE / FAKE) plus an overall hallucination summary.
  [Routing] Do NOT use for general paper search, scholar lookup, citation-intent analysis, or building a citation graph — use aminer-academic-search, aminer-free-academic, or paper-source-trace instead. This skill only verifies whether references actually exist.

# PDF Citation Verifier

Verify whether the references in a paper PDF actually exist by submitting the PDF to the AMiner `pdf-citation-verifier` service, polling the asynchronous job, and returning a structured summary. Invoke via natural language or `/pdf-citation-verifier`.

## What This Skill Does

For each reference parsed from the uploaded PDF, the upstream service queries AMiner SearchPro and labels the citation with one of:

- `REAL` — high-confidence match in AMiner.
- `LIKELY_REAL` — partial match, likely genuine.
- `NEEDS_REVIEW` — evidence is inconclusive; ask a human.
- `LIKELY_FAKE` — partial mismatch, probably fabricated.
- `FAKE` — no plausible match found.

Each call to the gateway returns the standard envelope `{"code": 200, "success": true, "msg": "", "data": ..., "log_id": "..."}`. The script unwraps it before printing.

- `POST /api/v3/paper/citation/verify/upload` returns `data: {"job_id": "verify_..."}`.
- `GET /api/v3/paper/citation/result?job_id=...` returns `data: [<record>]` where the single record has top-level fields like `is_finish`, `has_hallucination`, `hallucination_ratio`, `total`, `counts_by_status`, `summary`, `urls`, `report`, `result`.
- Whenever the script sees `is_finish: true`, it also auto-downloads `urls.result` (the per-reference JSON) and inlines it as `details` on the returned payload — so a single `--output` file contains both the summary and every record's `status` / `confidence` / `title` / `first_author` / `key_reasons` / `top_match`, with no need to follow the 5-minute OSS link.

The skill returns that record plus the `job_id` so the user can re-poll later.

## File Map

- `SKILL.md` / `SKILL.zh.md` — English / Chinese skill definitions (this file).
- `commands/pdf-citation-verifier.md` — slash command entry.
- `scripts/verify_pdf.py` — HTTP client: upload → poll → print the unwrapped result record.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies (`requests`).

## Pre-flight

Run these checks before invoking the script. Stop and surface the error to the user if any check fails.

**1. AMINER_API_KEY**

```bash
[ -z "${AMINER_API_KEY+x}" ] && echo "AMINER_API_KEY missing" || echo "AMINER_API_KEY exists"
```

If missing, stop and tell the user to obtain a token from https://open.aminer.cn and `export AMINER_API_KEY=${AMINER_API_KEY}

**2. Python dependency**

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import importlib.util
missing = [name for name in ("requests",) if importlib.util.find_spec(name) is None]
print("Missing: " + ", ".join(missing) if missing else "Python dependencies exist")
PY
```

If missing, instruct: `pip install -r "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/requirements.txt"`.

**3. PDF input**

The user must supply an existing local `.pdf` file path. If they only describe a paper without a file, ask them to provide the PDF path. Do not invent or download a PDF.

## Execution Example

Basic verification with defaults (max 50 references, auto-polls until done):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/verify_pdf.py" \
  --pdf "/abs/path/to/paper.pdf"
```

Full options:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/verify_pdf.py" \
  --pdf "/abs/path/to/paper.pdf" \
  --max-refs 80 \
  --strict \
  --timeout 900 \
  --poll-interval 5 \
  --output outputs/pdf-citation-verifier/<safe-paper-stem>/result.json
```

Submit-only (no polling, return `job_id` for later lookup):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/verify_pdf.py" \
  --pdf "/abs/path/to/paper.pdf" --no-wait
```

Fetch the result for an existing `job_id` (no new upload):

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/verify_pdf.py" \
  --job-id verify_20260527T090207Z_a72c9ba5
```

## Parameters

| Flag | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--pdf` | required (unless `--job-id`) | Local `.pdf` file path. Server caps body at 50 MB. |
| `--job-id` | – | Skip upload and just fetch the result for an existing job. |
| `--max-refs` | 50 | Server hard cap is 100. |
| `--strict` | off | Stricter FAKE judgement on partial matches. |
| `--no-wait` | off | With `--pdf`: submit and return `job_id` without polling. With `--job-id`: single fetch, return immediately without looping. |
| `--timeout` | 600 | Overall polling timeout in seconds. |
| `--poll-interval` | 5 | Seconds between result polls. |
| `--request-timeout` | 120 | Per-HTTP-request timeout. |
| `--output` | - | Optional path to also write the JSON response. |

## Environment Variables

| Var | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AMINER_API_KEY` | yes | JWT used in the `Authorization` header. |
| `PDF_CITATION_VERIFIER_BASE_URL` | no | Override the gateway base URL. Defaults to `https://datacenter.aminer.cn/gateway/open_platform`. |

## Runtime Constraints

- **Never** print, log, or echo the value of `AMINER_API_KEY`.
- **Never** fabricate verification verdicts. If the script fails or times out, surface the error verbatim — do not synthesize results.
- `urls`, `report`, `result`, `pdf` in the response point to server-side artifacts and may be pre-signed for `url_expire_seconds`. Do not claim those local paths exist on the user's machine. Use `--output` if the user needs a local copy of the JSON.
- Respect the per-user active job cap (server returns 429 when exceeded). If a 429 surfaces, stop and tell the user to wait for prior jobs to finish.
- Treat any `LIKELY_FAKE` / `FAKE` verdict as a flag for human review, not a final accusation. Surface `counts_by_status` and per-record reasons when the response includes them.

## Output Presentation

After the script returns, summarize the result for the user with at minimum:

- `job_id`
- `total` (number of references verified)
- `has_hallucination`, `hallucination_ratio`
- A short table built from `counts_by_status` (REAL / LIKELY_REAL / NEEDS_REVIEW / LIKELY_FAKE / FAKE / etc.)
- If `details.records[]` is present (auto-fetched from `urls.result`), list each FAKE / LIKELY_FAKE / NEEDS_REVIEW record's `title`, `first_author`, `year`, and `key_reasons` so the user does not have to follow the 5-minute OSS link
- Any `urls.report` / `urls.result` links from the response, with a note that they may expire after `url_expire_seconds`
- The full JSON should be either saved (via `--output`) or echoed back to the user, never silently dropped.

If the inline details fetch failed, the payload carries a `details_fetch_error` string — surface it and tell the user to GET `urls.result` themselves before `url_expire_seconds` runs out.

If `is_finish` is `true` and a `status` / `msg` field signals failure, report it and suggest re-running.
